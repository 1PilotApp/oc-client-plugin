## About us

1Pilot is brought to you by a team of hard-core Swiss developers from [Inetis](https://inetis.ch/). We love coding and
creating powerful apps for our clients. Tired of spending excess time maintaining our website roster, we built our own
site monitoring and management platform.

Our goal is to bring people and technology together using open source tech like OctoberCMS. Sharing 1Pilot with the
world brings us closer to achieving our goal.
